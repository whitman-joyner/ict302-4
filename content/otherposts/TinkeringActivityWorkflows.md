Today as a group we talked about a workflow model for creating a post on a site like hugo. First in the process we decided that in this situation having the boss be the client makes sense because both would inform you about the task and dictate the final product. We also agreed that the editor and content manager jobs are the same because the content manager would oversee the content and make sure its quality, which would be the same as an editor reviewing the content for quality reasons. That being said our work model looks something like this. Frst the client/boss would pitch thee idea and send it to the content manager/editor. The content manager would then look at idea and give the information off to the content creator/writers who would then create the content and send it in for review. The content manager would review the content and make any changes and send it back to the writer if need be, but if it is given the green light it would be sent back to the boss/client. If the client approves then they would take the content to the publishing company/site and from there the IT/technical people would upload the content to the site and it would be published for public viewing.
