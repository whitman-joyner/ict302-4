As I continue to learn about Hugo and setting up our group contract, I find that I have searched online for additional resources for contract ideas, goals to reach and how to divide tasks between group members.  Research is going to be critical to each week as we move forward.  Researching other competitorsâ€™ web pages, image ideas for different products, fonts that work well/poorly displaying different content.  While this is not a set instruction during class, it is just as important to find some of these things ourselves.  Googling other moving companies I found, storage container movers, large vehicle movers, moving teams with a large truck, and more.  Starting here gives suggestions for our group to begin discussions on what we want to offer on our site.  Once we make a few more decisions, then I can look for additional resources to help us make our WordPress site look more professional.  So I am confident to say that I can find and use resources for self-directed learning.
