Working with Hugo is a multiple step process to get one post uploaded.  It is ideal for the individual who understands coding in more detail.  I have very little experience with GitHub, using command prompt, and then trying to use the two together to get a post uploaded.  This process was more detailed and took a bit more time in order to feel confident in my steps.  It was taken me about three weeks to feel comfortable with Hugo.  Today we logged into WordPress (WP) for the first time in class.  In less than an hour, I was able to create a post, upload an image and even create and add a calendar function to our footer.  The calendar was not something I could do in Hugo yet.  So having the preset functions, allowed me to add to a website a lot faster.
