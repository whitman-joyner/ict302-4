The cms I lokked at is alchemycms mostly because it sounded cool and it immediatly said that it is available on github kind alike how Hugo is through github from my understanding. Kinda like hugo it aysinformation is stored on a database but they store less information onto the database, like only th ids for information rather than all of it like hugo does. Unlike hugo this seems to have more templates available and also work more with workign with indivuial parts of a site rather than a theme and posts like hugo does. It would actually probably be beneficial for our group since looking at alchemys showcase of sites, most seem to be buisneses related or traight up buiness sites. They laso have certain features like contact forms which would help us with our ite even though we are creating our ite in wordpress, that eature could be beneficial so we dont have to rely on plugins for wordpress.
