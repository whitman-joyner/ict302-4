I can manage content using established workflows.
This week we learned about some new features that Hugo offers.  Things like menus, themes, etc.  As our group worked together and individually, I noticed how our lesson from last week – Workflow was beginning to come into action.  While we tried individually to get specific function up and running, it was result when we worked as a team.  Even though we were still unsuccessful, working together allowed us to see each person’s strong points.  So at the end of the week as we worked on our group contract, it became a little easier to see who would fit into the sequence of different roles; administrative, editorial, and other processes that our website would need to go through.  

As we begin to layout a more specific plan for our website, we can see how this workflow of tasks will come in handy to make sure that each person is completing their data that is needed for that section.  Each person in our group has an important role within our work flow.  Communication, IT, Research and Editing will be four importing steps to make sure our website will cover all the important information that we want our users to be able to see and know about our company.
