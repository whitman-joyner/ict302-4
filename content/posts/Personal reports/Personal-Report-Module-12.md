I can identify and define key concepts in (web) content management
This week we discussed about content moderation and the way different platforms handles content. Every users can create content but they have to follow fixed set of rules that are implied the companies. For instance: twitter removes that posts that include hate speech, Gab does not allow pornography. Generally users do not know the policies of the platform unless their posts is taken down. Since, social media platforms has a wide reach to the community users should be respectful towards each other and instead of thinking they have right to free speech they need to read the companies rules and polices regarding content moderation. So content moderation helps to maintain harmony among the users and if users do not agree with the policies they can switch to other platforms.
