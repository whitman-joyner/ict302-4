I can identify and employ technologies related to content management:
This week we discussed about plug-ins and extensions. Since most of the content management systems do not have an advance functionality plug-ins helps to add the features. And based on the needs users can choose the appropriate extensions. We created a general layout for our website but we were having issues with shopping cart, products lists, and payment method. So to resolve the issue we are using WooCommerce plug-in. WooCommerce is free, easily customizable and offers several secure payment methods. It is user friendly and it has all the features that we need to add to our website.
