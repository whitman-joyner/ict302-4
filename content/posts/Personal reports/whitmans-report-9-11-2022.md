I can identify and define key concepts in (web) content management: So this is the closest one i could think of ffor the i cans to what we discused inlecture this week. Wendsdays class largly seemed to revolve around revenue models within content creation and management. Stuff like patreon models, physical merch sales, grants, and ads. This relates to the group project as our project will require us to consider how we will be selling our products. More specifically for a store front is what denomination will you be selling your goods and how will that be convayed to the customer.
