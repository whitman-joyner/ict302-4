I can identify and define key concepts in (web) content management
Choosing a CMS can be difficult because users should first look at the features that the platform offers, then compare it with other CMS and then choose the platform that fulfills their needs. There are various open source CMS platforms but they do not offer the advance features so users have the option to choose the commercial CMS platforms. CMS like WordPress can be installed manually whereas Hugo uses SaaS model because several other technologies like code editor, GitHub are used to upload the content. WordPress is a popular CMS because it is easy to use, does not require advance technical skills, and offers variety of themes for elegance whereas Hugo is mostly used by users that are interested to learn the back end work and are more focused in the practicality rather than elegance. So, users compare different factors while choosing a CMS.
