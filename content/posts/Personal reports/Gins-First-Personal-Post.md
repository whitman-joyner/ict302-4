* I can find and use resources for self-directed learning.
So after class I only had this assignment to complete.  I was not confident that I 
would remember all the steps.  But with the resources of classmates and YouTube
I was determined to figure this out.  

I have only taken one programming class, so this is still kind of new to me.  But
I do enjoy a good challenge.  So this week, I can say that I CAN find and use resources
for self-directed learning.
