This week we mostly discussed about the types of content management system and learned about how we can pick the best CMS for our needs. There are plenty of CMS out there with different tools and functions but we can choose a CMS that can be easily modified, altered, and changed based our needs. We used Hugo for the past four weeks and we have had several issues while uploading and synching through GitHub maybe that's why it is not the popular CMS, but WordPress is currently the number one CMS that is used by most of the big companies as it is easy to use and it is a open source platform. So, by experimenting and learning about the two CMS I believe I can describe and compare content management systems.
