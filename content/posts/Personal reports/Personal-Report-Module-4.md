This week we discussed about the various roles involved in content management. And we also discussed about the specific workflow that is used to complete a project. Dividing a task based on the expertise of team members helps to complete the project effectively. Workflow also helps to keep track of the project and communicate with the team members.

So based on this weeks reading as a team we have established a workflow to complete our project which is to create a website for a moving company. My role in that task would be to look at the creative section. I would import the images that would be visually appealing to the users and make sure that the website looks presentable. Likewise I would also communicate with the team members to keep track of the deadline to complete certain phases of the project. So, with the help of the readings and some prior knowledge about gathering information from multiple sources I believe I can manage content using established workflow.
