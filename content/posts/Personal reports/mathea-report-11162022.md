This week we worked with plugins and I think it is a fitting tie in to the 'I can' statement about employing technologie related to content maganement. For our Hugo site we didnt add any plugin sbecaue we foudn that they dont add any ignificant features that would help us with the creation or upkeep of content. We did however add a plugin to our wordpres site as well as chaneg the theme of our site a while back, both of which help with the content of our site. The theme  is just an aestheitc thing tho so I wont go into detail for that. the plugin was Woocomemrce. Basically we saw that our site lacked soem fuctionality we wanted it to have a and added a plugin to give us that functionality, it also changed the site a bit as now there were imput for differnt kinds of content (such as merchandise, paymnt, cart, etc.), this was a choice we made to add the plugin to help our content. It is litterally a technology realted to technology managemrnt in my opinion, just becasuse of what it does in relation to the content and the site.
