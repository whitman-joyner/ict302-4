This week we learnt about WordPress, I had smooth transition from Hugo to WordPress because I think it is so much easier to create and publish content on WordPress. One best part of WordPress is that we can see the format of our website instead of all the back-end process. And we can create a post without using a code editor. This week Whitman and I decided to look into the themes and customize it based on our website's needs. We have found a theme but we are also messing around with the other new features, but I have got an idea on how WordPress works and use it to maximize our website's appearance.
So, this week I can say, I can identity and employ technologies related to content management.
