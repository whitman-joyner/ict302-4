This week I had a major issue while publishing a Hugo post. I created a post, saved it in the file and pushed it through the Github desktop. I was able to see the post in the Github website but I couldn't find it in the local host. I didn't know what I did wrong but later Whitman sent me message saying I broke the netflify website because I forgot to add a header for my post. I was completely unaware that I forgot to included the header. I looked through my post multiple times trying to figure out how to fix the issue. Then after watching multiple YouTube video's, searching various queries and comparing my post with my team mates, I was able to fix the issue. I asked for help with my team mates but I also used self directed learning to resolve the issue. So this week I can proudly say that I can find and use resources for self- directed learning.
