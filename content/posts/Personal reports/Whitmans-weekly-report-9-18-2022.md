I can identify and define key concepts in (web) content management: This week we largly talked about workflows which are constructed system to pass content that is changed or altered based on the need or certain individuals or situations. For instance lets say you want to create an ad. You would commision someone to create that ad like an agency. the agency would send that request to a manager who would deligate it to an agent who would create the ad. the ad would be sent back up to the manager who would request changes or send it back to you for aproval. If you dont aprove it would go back down that chain or head to publishing. The workflow would look sommething like this. agent <-> Manager <-> agency <-> You <-> Publishing. The importance of workflow is to keep things running smothly by having everybody know what their supposed to do and how the work is going to get done.
