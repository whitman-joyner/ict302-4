I can identify and employ technologies related to content management
This week we discussed about content and presentation. Content is a huge part of a website but presentation is also another equally important aspect which a lot of designers tend to forget. For our website we are trying to use a drop down menu, but somehow it is not working. And as suggested by Dr Greenhalgh I think if we use a plug-in that works with WordPress we can add the drop-down menu feature. To resolve our issue we can use Mega Main Menu plug-in because it helps to customize the drop down menu items/content. It also lets us to assert links, images and texts in the drop down menu. And the plug-in should be compatible with our theme.
