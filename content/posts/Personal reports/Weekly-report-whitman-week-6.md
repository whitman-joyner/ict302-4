I can describe and compare content management systems: this week was an introduction to word press which is much easier to use than hugo but still manages to be a pain in the ass. Hugo was much more straight forward about being a file managment content system which if you knew what you were doing made it easy to work with. Big if though. Wordpress by contrest is more of a menu and setting based content system which is a lot easier to use but much harder to fix a persistant problem. Right now i'm having trouble with getting hyperlinks into the different pages for our hugo site and if this was hugo i could much more easily look at which file was causing the problem but now i have no idea where the setting thats causing the issue is.
