Describing Content Management Systems
Content management systems (CMS) is software that can aid in managing the creation of digital content.  CMS also allows the user to made any modifications needed when they need to. Hugo and WordPress are two versions we will be working with in class.  While a CMS is beneficial, there are aspects that also need to be considered.  

Who will be responsible for different sections of content?  Editing, Management, Writers, IT (uploading), programming, and more are just a few that we have talked about this week.  Each role is as important as the others.  Creating a workflow to upload content, can prevent errors, assist with employees who are absent, uploading within a specific time frame and making sure the client has the information needed.

Having a workflow process in place and activated, the content management system site can pushed out to the website on time and ready for online viewers to use immediately.
