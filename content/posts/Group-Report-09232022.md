Our Hugo website is still coming along.  Whitman was able to get a theme to upload!  Yea, insert an applause here.  He was also able to get a truck image to appear with each post.  These small steps that have made huge results on our site.  It is amazing how those little details can make big improvements.   We worked together on our group contract.  Kusmira tried to work on importing a theme but was still unsuccessful.  Whitman showed her in class how he was able to get it to work.  Mathea continued read on different instructions on how to work with Hugo.
