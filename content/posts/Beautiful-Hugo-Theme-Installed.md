This week during our Tinkering Time our group tinkered with finding and installing a Theme.  The one chosen was “Beautiful Hugo”.  I guess beauty sometimes means extra work.  Cause there were some issues and extra steps after they downloaded the zip file.  

Once everything was fixed and completed, our layout looks so much better.  It has a more professional feel to it.  So the extra work, possible headaches, was all worth it.
