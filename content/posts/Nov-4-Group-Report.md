Group 4 has worked diligently to get our WP site up and completely functioning.  We are looking for extensions and/or plug ins for checking out with the shopping cart.  Currently we are using the plug in, Woocommerce.  This is the shopping cart features, product features and ability to have accounts.  This has been helpful to make our site more functioning for the customer.    After discussing the need for a plug in for a shopping cart function with our professor, he was able to get one for us that would allow our site to accommodate it.  Normally, this is the part of researching plug ins to find out the best fit, widely used, less hacking, and other important features that as a business owner would be interested in.  

Our website is coming along nicely.  It feels more interactive now with this new plug in installed.  Now we are testing and deciding other things we may want to add or change.
