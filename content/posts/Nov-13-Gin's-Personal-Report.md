One of the features that a CMS can have is generated content by a public user.  You can find examples on Yelp that will publish a businessâ€™ general information but customers can log on and post a comment of their personal review, good or bad.  This is also a place that a business can use a content moderator that not hired by the company.  For example, some social media sites will use volunteer content moderators who assist with monitoring the content that users are posting, remove comments/images that are not approved content per policy.
