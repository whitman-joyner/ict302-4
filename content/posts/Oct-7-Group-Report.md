Today our group worked on our website design and designating more specific roles and assignments for team members.  This week our goal is to work on our Header and adding the social media links.  
Whitman will create the header, adding in a Home, About Us, Pricing, Cart and Sign-in Pages.  This week Mathea will work on gathering the Truck Pricing: images, description and pricing.  Kusmira will work on Hourly labor.  While Ginetta works on Moving Supplies.  The three will take their pricing information and add it to the Pricing Page that has already be created.  

We will also add these job duties can be added to the group contract.
