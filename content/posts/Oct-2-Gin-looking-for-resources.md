This week our group work on our WP site.  The header was our biggest focus.  The image of a moving truck that we “practiced” putting up on the site worked but we are not happy with the quality of the image.  

Whitman and Kusmira work diligently to locate a theme for our page.  Matthea and I worked on researching prices and other menu options.

After I gathered up some information for the first drop down menu.  I jumped onto Youtube to find out how to create it.  The sites I found talked about creating it under categories.  Even though I did these steps, I ran into a few issues.  Even while in class, with a few little issues here and there, I continue to work on trying to get this function up and running hopefully by the end of the week.

The preplanning steps and looking at other movers’ sites allowed me to see how much content that they also used.  Most of it was basic:  image of the item, size of each item, cost per hour, and weights. 

Now that I have some of that information organized on paper, now I want to learn how to make some title bold.  WP help link has been great with learning a few steps. This usually gets me going pretty well.
