Todya we looked at our site (a local moving website), and figured that for a company site like ours only a few social media platforms made sense to us. We figured that twitter and linkedin made sence. Linkedin would be to keep up a profesional look, and to make ourelves seem more professional. Twitter is to post news and updates about the company. From the  dicusion today it also seemed pretty easy to implement and makes sense to have socials linked on the webite as many small to medium buisnese have social to keep people in the loop as well as spread word about the comapny.
