This week have been working on updating the information on the website. Today we have updated the pricing page on the site to add more information and have also been trying to add a drop down menu to the page so that there can be a selection based on number of movers for pricing reasons but trying to get that on the page casued some issues. Whitman tried to update the theme to get the dropdown to work but it didnt work yet. Kusmira have been looking up prices and added the prices to the pricing page and Gin uploaded a work document with images and description of some other items to go on the site such as moving trucks etc. We also talked about the permission our site was given which allows us to change the site name and title and add some tag lines to better customize the site.
