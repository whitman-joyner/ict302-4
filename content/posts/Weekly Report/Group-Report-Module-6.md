This week as a group we messed around with the new WordPress site. Whitman and Kusmira looked through the themes to customize menus, fonts, and background for our website. Mathea and Gin worked on menu options, they decided to add a web name along with pricing and its drop down menu will include size of the truck, hourly labor price. This week was all about trial and error within the WordPress site.
