This week we worked in the framework of the business and we created a group contract. As a group we decided to create a website for a moving company that would be useful for both students and other customers. The goal of our company/website is to provide service and information to our customers and forwarding the information to us. Besides this we also worked on creating a group contract that validates our work based on the grading system.
