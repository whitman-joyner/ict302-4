Group 4’s website is growing each week.  This week we started looking at what our site currently has that is functioning to check off our contract.  Then we were able to evaluate what other items were needed to improve both our overall goal and each group member’s contributing factors.  

Evaluating the C level work, we were able to mark off: 
1.	Checkout
2.	Shopping Cart
3.	Ability to select products to go into shopping cart
4.	2-3 typos/grammar errors
5.	Color background only.
We did notice that the way the shopping cart is currently set up, there is not a need a customer to set up their own account.  So we know that this will need to be reworded when we work on the contracts again.

Evaluating the B level work, there are a few decisions left to make.  
1.	 Updated detailed description of products and images – Completed
2.	Business contact information (footer) – Needs to be completed.
3.	Employee log in – Might not need this function any more.
4.	0-1 typos/grammar errors – Completed
5.	Menu options – completed.
Next week after make a few little decisions, we will be able to finish B level work and then address the A level work.  As the semester begins to wrap up, this allows up to make sure that we are meeting the level of expectation that we collectively want as a group.

Each group member has contributed as listed:
Whitman has monitored, added pages, menus, products, images and more to our website.  He is also assisting group members with any issues they are having while working on their section of the website.  
Kusmira is keeping us on task with making sure we are completing different sections.  She changed the color of our website today but also making sure that making that change did not cause issues on other pages with multiple images that might class in color.
Matthea was able to upload her products, descriptions and prices to the products page today.  
Ginetta has continued to keep everyone updated on teams.  Her products, descriptions and prices have been uploaded to the Products page.  She completed a test order that worked seamlessly.  And then made a post on the website regarding the weather (possible FAQ page).
