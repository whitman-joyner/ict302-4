I can identify and define key concepts in (web) content management: This week i was out with the flu so i kind of dont remember a lot of it. This week was user generatted content which is something we've kind of been talking about in my ict 205 class. Users aren't just consumers of you content they are in a was creators of micro content in their comments and modifiers of your cms throught the attention they bring. You could be promoting bird watching but the comments are all about consipracy theories. So managing the user content is just as important as managing the main content. You can due this through 3 ways. first is personall review where you hire someone to look at all content posted and delete anything you dont want there but this can be expenseive and slow. The second is an algorithim that picks the content out, this is cheap to impliment but can be exploited. Third is to use a flagging system to track down bad posts, this is cheap but it can lead to peaple abusing flags to bully people. So you have a lot of ups and downs and the answear is something in the middle of all three.
