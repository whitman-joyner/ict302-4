This week we messed around with the layouts of the themes we are using for hugo. Basically we went into our themes files and chnaged the settings in our layout files. In our case its something called beautiful Hugo. The layouts format each post/page automatically which makes them very usuefull for sontent agregation because you can format your layout to display the informtaion you think the user will need at anygiven time. As an example the layout format could have a header with a menu that acts as a navigation panel to the rest of your site.
