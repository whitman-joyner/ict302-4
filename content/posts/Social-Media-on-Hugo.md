This week we learned how to add social media to our Hugo sites.  With all the different types of social media content flatforms available, having a link on a personal website can build a larger specific audience.  Whitman was able to add GitHub to our Hugo site.  While this is just one of the different platforms available, he explaine to me how he got it added.
