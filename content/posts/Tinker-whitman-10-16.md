so hugo as a cms focuses on a balance of flexibibilty in design and useability to the end user. Compared to some other cms development hugo is much more user friendly but it is way behind something like wordpress. this is because Hugo leans more open source which allows you to change it in more ways than a box cms. The draw back to open source is you are reliant on updates from the curator of the database your using or fixing it yourself, there is no professional obligation to fix something wrong with the code because its free.
