Which extensions do you think would be particularly helpful? The top of my list is the starter kits. They look like the wordpress themes which streamline the posting process. Second would be the editor plug in's as i often know what i want to do but end up having trouble getting hugo or wordpress to do it. An editor plug in would give me more ways to aproach an implimentation process.
Which don't you get? The comercial search services, like i thought theyd be seo but it sounds like their just web serching services.
