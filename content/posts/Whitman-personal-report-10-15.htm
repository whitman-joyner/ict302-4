I can identify and employ technologies related to content management: So this weeks topic was the difference between content and presentation. Now were really getting into using wordpress which means I'm in the middle of banging my head against the wall trying to figure out how to get wordpress to do the things i want it to do. I'm used to HTML which i can get to work just fine on hugo but word press apears to only use part of HTML and/or css. Both of these languages can be seen as our presentation element because they take the content (mostly posts) and displays them on the site. So now i need to figure out what code works and what doesnt.
