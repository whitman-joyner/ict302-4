I can identify and employ technologies related to content management: We are using github to store our content for our website, netlify to publish our website, and terminal to create and test our content. 

I can find and use resources for self-directed learning: Currently we have websites that can teach us how to use Hugo.

I can manage content using established workflows: So curently the way we create posts is to have the terminal create a file, push that file onto github, edit the file on github and then let netlify publish it.
