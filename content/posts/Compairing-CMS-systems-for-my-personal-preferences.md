Elementor:  Seems to me an aid to assist with building your WordPress website.  This looks like it is for the small business person that really doesn’t have an IT person or an actual IT department.  It also is known for being able to integrate with third party plugins.  This would depend on it these are needed for the business owner.  Elementor is allows the WYSIWYG editor, page templates, mobile design and section for Admin.

Wix  is a website builder that does not require the user to know coding.  It is customizable with a library of themes, and  eCommerce solutions for shopping capability.  This is not a free option but it is one of the cheaper CMS options.

Joomla is an open source CMS with lots of features.  Some of those features include: publishing web content, international language support, blogs, polls and search functions to mention just a few.  It is also a free CMS for the user.  While it does have its down flaws, if the user is strong in computer skills and coding, then the learning curve for Joomla would not be too hard to handle.  

Out of the three CMS’ that I looked at during class today, I personally would like to try working with Elementor more.  I have enjoyed working with WordPress but there are still aspects of WP that I am not strong with.  I would like to experiment with Elementor.  

I am not super comfortable with HUGO so when looking for a CMS for personal or my business use, I would prefer to find something more like WP with the preset selections.  Depending on the price range to additional assistance, I would not mind paying 10-20 dollars per month for their IT resources at hand.
