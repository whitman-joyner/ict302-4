Going from black to blue.  While a bruise might be temporary, so was changing the black font color to blue was only temporary.  I was able to open the file and look for places to change colors. I first looked for the black to see if it was related to font color.  Once I confirmed it was, then I changed it to blue.  I made a couple other black to blue changes and then saved my work.

Before I could save my work, Kusmira had already notice the change.  I enjoyed the fact that my classmate was able to see the change before I did.  Then to make sure our site was put back together, I revered the changes back to black.  

This tinkering time demonstrated to me that there is a lot of attention to detail.  One section that has a change is easily effected by one other change.  So it was easier to make one small change to see how it impacts the website before moving forward.  This was a fun tinkering time.
