Whitman worked with Gin, Mathea, and Kusmire to make sure that each one was connecting and able to post.  He also walked each one through the step for future references. He also confirmed we had at least posted our Tinkering assignement.  Moving forward, we will continue to use our Teams folder that Ginetta set up so we can share files and communicate when not in class.
