This week we tried to change the theme for the hugo site. Kusmira found one called beautiful hugo so on her computer i changed the config file to pull from "beatifulHygo-master". This kind of broke the site as every link on the home page now came up with an error message. After changing the base url to the netlify site things began to work again. This is and example of presentation v. content because the content remained the same but our changes to the code which communicated that content changed how that content was seen.
