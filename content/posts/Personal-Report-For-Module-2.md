Barker defined content management as two main characters editorial process and intended for human  consumption. Editorial process includes the content that needs to be edited whereas human intended content includes actual post, graphics used to create a website not the behind the scene of the programming language.
Likewise the podcast of Anil Dash also clarified that not all people that write on the internet can be called as content creators.
So with all the information gained from the lecture and by learning how to create a Hugo post I believe I can identify and define key concepts in (web) content management.
