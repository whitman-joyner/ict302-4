The Adobe Experience Cloud (AEC) is a suit of tools for marketing departments under the adobe umbrella. The ease of functiona and service mentaility makes me think its closer to wordpress than hugo. The audience for AEC is marketing departments. The usefulness of AEC is down to adobe as a company who have been very successfull at making products that work and are supported. If you buy AEC you know its not going to break easily. The downside is you are beholden to adobe, and their constant price changes. 
Foswiki is documnet managment system created to help people create their own wiki sites. The audience is basically anyone who wants to create their own wiki. Foswiki is an open source document manager which means that you can easily change things within the code but you wont have much in terms of support and you may have to delve into extensions to get the code to do what you want it to do. Upside is it's free and the community has been working hard to keep it functional. It looks closer to hugo than wordpress.
Django CMS is a cms based on the django programing language, which is similar to python. As a language based cms the main upside to django is how flexible it is to modify, if you know how to program. Django allows you to change how things interact with the different elements of the cms. The downside is a need to undertand django before being able to use it. The target audience apears to be people trying to make site with specific specifications.
