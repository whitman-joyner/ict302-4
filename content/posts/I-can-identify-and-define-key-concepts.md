I can identify and define key concepts in (web) content management. 

 

Locating a CMS that is specific to a user’s need and technical skills could be a “out of the box” system or a pre-developed CMS.  While there are so many different styles of CMS out on the market for a user to have, it is important for each user to understand what skill level the software.  Some users prefer the open source so they are able to add code, change or modify existing codes.  Users can look online, read through community forums to locate a specific line(s) of code in order to create the function that they need.  But there are users who prefer to check a box and have that feature appear.   

Another need that a user may have is if they need to use the software remotely for any location or only while at work.  Installed software is used only on the computer at a specific location.  SaaS is having access from any location such as Google docs.
