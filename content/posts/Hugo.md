Hugo is a platform CMS that is ready to go out of the box.  It offers an open source that allows you to view the different codes available.  At this point, the user change many things through the code.  If they prefer to change the theme, it is a code that can be found online (through a community support)  and then integrated into the users site.  

There are also different technologies that go into helping Hugo run.  There are things such as Markdown, Golang, Strapi, Buddy and GitLab Pages are all stacked.  Having these different technology systems stacked allows it to be SaaS, Software as a Service.  This allows the users to be able have access to the software from any location.  In class we compared SaaS to Google Docs.  

Hugo is both practical and elegant.  It is difficult to say if it is either one or the other as it depends more on the individual who is using it.  For those who enjoy coding and the flexibility that it offers to manipulate the items on their page, they may feel that its more practical.  Then depending on their coding skills, they can make it look very elegant.
