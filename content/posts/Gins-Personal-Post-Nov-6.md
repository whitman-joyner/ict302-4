This week we learned about extensions and plugins.  My biggest obstacle with these is doing the research to find the best one for the situation that I am working on.  During the school year, professors require different software to be downloaded for exams that require plugins.  I have caught between a rock and a hard place as a student, because it’s required for testing but not sure if it is really safe.  So usually if I can take the test in person, I will usually opt for that.  Widely used plugins are used a lot within the universities.  How do students know that the safety of the plugin?  Or is more of a consistency that the university uses this site so it ‘seems safe’.    So as our group was looking at different plugins, I found a little comfort in knowing that we had our professor assisting us with the process/approving the use of the plugin for our site.
