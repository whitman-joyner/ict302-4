I can identify and employ technologies related to content management: so this week was about the use of modified products such as plug ins. plug ins are very usefull in increasing the usefullness of a product but they can also cause unintended consiquences. Anyone who has modded skyrim can tell you that finding and installing mods is the easy part finding out how you broke skyrim and why is the hard part. For the purpose of our cms not being carefull in what plugins we use can leave our site disfunctional or open to cyberattack so we need to be carefull.
