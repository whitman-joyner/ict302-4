This week we only looked at the functionality of the website. And looking back into our group contract for our A level work we have zero typos/grammar errors on the website. We are still discussing weather we want to add a background image or graphic on the website. Our website's name is almost finalized and it is named as "Let's Get Moving". Our shop page is also working which means once customer orders a product they will receive the confirmation of orders. Besides this we only have a few things that needs to be completed which are adding the company's contact information in the footer and adding quick links, log in and about page in the footer. So as a group we are on track to receive an "A" grade.
