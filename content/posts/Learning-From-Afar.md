Over this past week, I began searching for a new theme for our Hugo site.  While I was not in class this entire week, I struggled to figure out the steps, how to get it to our site and just other general questions.  This really hit home for me, and made me realized just how much we do in class and as a group.  If I had been in class, I would have understood and had answers faster but it was a nice challenge to see if I could identify and employ a new theme on my own.  Nice challenge!
