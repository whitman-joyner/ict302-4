Hugo is an open source content management system platform. Since it is open source users can modify, change, add and use the codes based on their needs.
Hugo has more of code features because users can change the themes and the layout of the page by modifying the codes and I would say it would fall more under practicality than elegance because few themes are available to mess around with. Hugo cannot run on its own, it needs several other products to function so it falls under SaaS model. Separate code editor is required to create a content and the content should sync through GitHub to be posted on the Hugo site. Although Hugo has several steps involved to create a post, it is useful for users that like to learn back end work.
