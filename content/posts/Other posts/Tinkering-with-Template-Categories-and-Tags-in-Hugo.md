For this weeks tinkering activity I tried to change the layout of our localhost server. Last week we installed a new Hugo theme "Beautiful Hugo" so by going through the layout section I choose one of the template and tried editing some of the tags but even after changing the tags I couldn't see any difference in the local host. I was also scared to sync the template through GitHub because it could crash the whole website. Hugo being a static site generator  lets users download the zip file and make basic changes to the tags and attributes. In our themes layout section we have three different files which were divided into default, partial and shortcuts and each section had several HTML files of header, footer, share links, etc. This assignment helped me to understand how Hugo is using the content aggregation to separate the files so that users won't have difficulty to find or change the attributes.
