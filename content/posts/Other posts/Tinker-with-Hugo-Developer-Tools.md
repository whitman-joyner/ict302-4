Today we discussed about some Hugo extensions and few of them would be useful. Since we are working with WordPress, an extension called 'wordpress-to-hugo-exporter' helps to convert all posts, pages, taxonomies, and metadata to markdown and YAML that can be dropped into Hugo. Hugo does not have a search bar so most of the extensions helps to add the search bar, likewise comment section is also not available 'Disqus' a third party service can be added to the template. Hugo is not user friendly but with the help of extensions we can add a lot of new functionality. Hugo has moving parts and a lot of extensions involves complicated solutions. But some text editors works best with Hugo for instance: Atom. Based on users needs several plug-ins are available but users have to be careful about its security, compatibility and maintainability.
