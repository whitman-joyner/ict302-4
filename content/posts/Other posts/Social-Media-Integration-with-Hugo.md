For our website we decided to integrate Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn. For our target audience I think Facebook would be a useful site likewise for the professional look LinkedIn would be a wise choice and Twitter would be useful for sharing and updating the news. Even though we don't have to actually create account in the mentioned social media platforms, just adding the icon would make the website more engaging and appealing.
