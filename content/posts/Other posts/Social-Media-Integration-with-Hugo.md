For our website we decided to integrate Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn. For our target audience I think Facebook would be a useful site likewise for the professional look LinkedIn would be a wise choice and Twitter would be useful for sharing and updating the news. Social media channels are crucial for content creators because it helps to distribute the content to the specific audience. For instance: people won't know about our website unless we create a page or share it in social media. We can find websites without the integration of social media platforms but it won't be that popular. Likewise, distributing content across multichannel helps to keep audience informed.
