Today we looked at Hugo extenions and the firt thing I noticed is that they all bring up a github site to find the files and things like that. Also soem of the are to change the interface adn make it more user friendly but most just add one really small feature (like a search bar), and figuring out how to install it is a lot more difficult than it is worth beceuse it is such a small feature. I also noticed that msot are jut for one kind of search bar or they add some of site translation, which makes sense why those two thing are most common. Neither of these are really neccessary for our site but maybe a search bar would be practical. So something like hugo search index would help us find our posts when we need them later in the semesster, or if we have a proper hugo site that has users coming to it on  a regular basis it woul dmake ense to search for post in case there is content that is older but is interesting to a new user, or to help them find info on a topic. It basically would just add some eas of acces to the site.
