For our tinkering activity, I installed a theme named "Beautiful Hugo" for our website. But after downloading the zip file we had a configurating issue and we could see the topic but when we click on the post we got an error message. But somehow Whitman figured it out and we were able to change the new theme to our Hugo website. The downloading process was easy but it helped us to understand the importance of presentation. When we changed the theme the layout looked completely different and I think the new theme looks more aesthetically pleasing. Content is a key element for any website/posts but presentation is also equally important as it attracts viewers and if the overall layout (styles, color, font, shape) is not good then viewers won't pay attention to the content.
