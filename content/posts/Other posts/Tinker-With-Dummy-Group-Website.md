Today, in class we were supposed to create a dummy website of our group WordPress website in Hugo, but we failed miserably. I tried to edit the code and add details about our website but I was not able to do so. I also tried importing themes on our Ananke folder but I couldn't do it. Whitman created a new repository so that our old repository would not mess up when we try to code and submit it. But with the new repository I got even more confused and didn't know what to do! In order to create and upload a post we have to follow several steps in GitHub and I think it makes it more complicated. Dr Greenhalgh wanted us get us some practice before we create an actual website in WordPress but I think it made us more confused and frustrated.
