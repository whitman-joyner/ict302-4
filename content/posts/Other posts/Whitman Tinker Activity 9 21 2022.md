The activity was a little dificult but not for unituitive reasons. The manual nature of correcting everything within the files to change anythng is annoying but the trade off is the ability to have unparralled customization with your site. Manualy adding in new menues in the config file is anoying but i can change almost anything about their values whereas something like square space would require me to be within certain parameters. It's like the difference bwtweeen a dell and a linux box.
