# **Tinkering Activity**
So this week we worked with hugo and learned about making posts through hugo and syncing it using github. Looking though how to set all this up, it eems like something htat will get easier over time as it is just a process to remeber, like opening the website, then making sure its synced and then gettign into the meat of it seem straight forward.
