Comparing with Hugo, I think WordPress is simple and user friendly. To create a post in Hugo we had to go through a long process, in which we had to create a file, sync the file using GitHub and then publish it to the local server but in WordPress we can directly create and publish a post without using another code editor. The dashboard of WordPress is also very easy to navigate and we can import images without any hassle. We used Hugo in the beginning and understood the back end process of creating a content whereas WordPress only shows the front end work. All the features in WordPress is laid out evenly and so far I did not had any issue navigating this popular content management system.
