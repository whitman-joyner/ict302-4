So as I was a bit late to class I was able to feel the frusteration of the others in my group as when I arrived Whitman was switching between three laptops trying to get thing to work for our group sent up a dummy site for us to pratice on and get a feel for how we would set up a website like we had talked about. I remeber them having an issue with setting up a theme, which is something I think we had issues with when setting up the website initially. When I went in after class to look at the example site given, it seemed really simple and that plus the issues my group, and the other groups around us had made me think that Hugo isn't very good for website building unless it is on a very basic level. Even if trying to do something simple like insert a form for contating someone on a ite seems like it is done in the most basic of ways visually, but becaue ther are so many steps to hugo even the littest things are so complicated. Because it is a constant hasle of trying to download files, then copy them, puh them pull them test it fail delete push pull delete copy it just becomes so bothersome extremely quickly, adn in that fruteration, steps get mixed or mised and the whole site ends up not working so it has to be repushed or repulled from someone elses computer just to fix it and it it back to how it was prior to doing anything which puts you back at square one. On top of all tht Hugo isnt event really a site itslef, it works wit other applications to work, so managing several things at once makes even little tasks feel difficulet. I really hope that wordpress is more beginner frieldly because this site is kind of off putting to use.
