So obviously word press is a lot easier to use because of how many steps it takes to do something. Take just creating a post. In hugo we would have to use terminal to create a file. Then either upload that file to github or edit the file with a text editor first before editing it in github. Then we would have to synch everything before waiting for netlify to pulbish it first. With word press we just click on add post in the editor. Now everything being easier is good but like i said in class its missing two important aspects. 1st is that you are reliant on wordpress releasing features for you to use and 2nd you have less of a sense of accomplishment.
