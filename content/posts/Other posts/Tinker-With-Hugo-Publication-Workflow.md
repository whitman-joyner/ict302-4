As a group we have decided to create a content for a sports magazine. If the company have to cover a game or some information about a certain club should be published first a client gets in contact with the owner of the company. Then the owner will hand over the project to the project manager. The project manager will give the detailed instruction to the writer. The writer will create a content and then will submit it to the editor so that they will only include the necessary information. After editing the content the editor sends it back to the project manager and the project manager will submit it back to the owner. And after reviewing the content the owner will send it to the IT to publish it either online or in a paper form. So, there is a long process of workflow involved in a creation and publishing of a post/magazine.

Hugo features that can be used in the workflow would be the publishDate as the publication can input future date to publish the content. expiryDate can also be used to remove the content.

Other Software that can be used would be spreadsheet, calendar, and excel. Spreadsheets can be used to document the overall project and describe the role of each employees. Google calendar can be used to view the due dates and publishing dates.

Other consideration would be to provide reliable and accurate information to the consumers.
