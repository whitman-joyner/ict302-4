Today was not a good day.  I was thankful for the heads up that today can end with not being able to get anything accomplished.  Leaving class today, I felt discouraged with Hugo.  I feel like I am about nine hundred steps behind.  I am not sure if it is because Hugo has so many steps in order to post or if its how we are doing things as a group.  
So today after our example lesson we as a group tried working together to just change the title.  Whitman decided to create a new hugo site for us to tinker with so we don’t mess up our current site.  So it took a little bit for him to get that up and going.  Once that was done, he decided we needed to try a new theme. But I struggle to understand where our new site was and how to upload any changes to it.  I felt better when Kushmira had that same issue.  Whitman worked with her to explain the steps of how to get a theme to the new site.  Then he tried showing me.  I still did not understand, even after he moved files around for me on my computer.  
Once all the changes were made to my computer, I still was unable to figure out how to download a theme and get it to our repository.  Because I wasn’t able to try at least one thing, I feel like I am falling behind in class.  Moving forward with WordPress next week, I am hoping that this process get easier.
