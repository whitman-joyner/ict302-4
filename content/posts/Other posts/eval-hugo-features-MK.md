Looking at Hugo and the notes from this weeeks lectures I think Hugo would be considered an open source csm because we have acess to the code of the cms and can change it when we please. It also has an interetsting technology stack I think because Hugo also uses github, so there is some kind of heierarchy of tech just because of that. Likely hugo is higher than github ince hugo is where all the content is created and manipulated while github is just the server from my understanding. It is also a content management sytem as all the work is doen before the content goes up, there is a way to edit content, but most of hte work is doen before ppublication. Hugo would also fall under the saas model because it is through github adn if has to be used in a sertain way therough thier servers adn while we can edit a lot of things, ultametly the site isnt in our control.
