Today as a group we talked about a workflow model for creating content on a sports website. the first step is to consider how content is order. what we came up with is that the site owner would dictate what should be covered. then the order is passed down to the content managers. the content managers would decide who covers what and in what time frame. the order is then passed to the content creators. the content creators create the content and pass it back up to the content managers who edit the content and send it up to the site owner or back down to the content creators for changes. Then the site owner would either aprove of the content and send it out for publication or back down the chain for changes. Once it is sent for publication the IT worker sends it to the publication software of their choice, which in turn sends it to the server. I tried to put in a picture of the chart but i couldn't get it to work so here is a mock up. CC<->CM<->SO->IT->Publish.
